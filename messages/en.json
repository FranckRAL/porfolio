I'm <strong>Franck Andritina</strong>, a Web Developer who believes that building great software is as much about <em>human connection</em> as it is about syntax.</p><p>My approach goes beyond just writing lines of code. I focus on <b>software craftsmanship</b>—ensuring every solution is scalable, maintainable, and high-performing. For me, quality isn't an afterthought; it's the foundation of the entire development process.</p><p>I thrive in <b>collaborative environments</b>. Whether it's leading a project, participating in code reviews, or brainstorming with a team, I leverage my <em>soft skills</em> and <b>Agile management</b> experience to bridge the gap between technical requirements and business goals.</p>",
